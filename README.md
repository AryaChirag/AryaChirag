### Hi there! I’m Chirag Arya 👋

👨🏻‍💻 About Me

👋 I am an MBA graduate in International Business with a strong foundation in Information Technology.

🚀 I recently completed an intensive Data Analytics Bootcamp at Le Wagon, where I honed my skills in Python, SQL, Excel, and BI tools like PowerBI, Looker Studio, and Tableau. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and business growth.

👯 I am eager to contribute my expertise to the dynamic field of Data Analytics. I'm actively seeking opportunities that allow me to harness the power of data for in-depth analysis, compelling visualization, and, ultimately, to drive business development through data-driven strategies.

🌱 In my previous role as a Business Operations Manager, I not only fulfilled my responsibilities but also achieved significant milestones. I spearheaded business expansion efforts, successfully establishing operations in three new cities from the ground up. This included the challenging task of launching and managing operations in Berlin.

🔭 During my time at Le Wagon's boot camp, I undertook a data-driven research project titled "Empowering Growth: Leveraging Python Machine Learning to Introduce Three Exciting Products to an Online Cosmetics Store." This project reflects my dedication to applying cutting-edge data analysis techniques to real-world business challenges.
